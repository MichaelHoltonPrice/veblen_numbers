#  Background
Veblen Numbers are rare Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs) that represent scarce
[Veblen goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veblen_good). They are available
for purchase at [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) and reside on the Polygon
blockchain. [Thorstein Veblen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorstein_Veblen)
was an influential economist who lived from 1857 to 1929. In honor of his work
and lasting legacy, we, the creators, will donate one-quarter of sales
revenue, including our share from secondary and subsequent sales, to
non-profit universities or organizations conducting fundamental scientific
research in Complexity Economics.

# Image generation
To generate the Veblen Numbers, which range from 0 to 999, clone this 
repository, change directory into it, and run the Python script 
make_veblen_numbers.py. This requires that PIL be installed and that the
DejaVuSans font is available. Once these requirements are met, generate the
images with the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MichaelHoltonPrice/p3k_baydem
cd p3k_baydem
python3 make_veblen_numbers.py
```
